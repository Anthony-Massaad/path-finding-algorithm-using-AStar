# path-finding-algorithm-using-AStar

# Desciption

Algorithm display using A* algorithm and pygame. Additional feature is diagonal checking if button is clicked for faster and more effecient path finding.

# Instuctions 

Red = start point

Blue = end point

Black = obstacle/path

Left click once for red, twice for blue and the rest will be black tiles

Right click deletes tiles back to white. If any start or end point gets deleted, then it needs to be set back using the left click again which will take priority over the black obstacles

# Buttons on the far right description

There is a button to reset the map, button to reset the points and obstacle path, and there is a button to reset the search if you feel to do the search again.

There is button that adds a diagonal feature, that turns green if it's on, otherwise grey
